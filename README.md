# deep-learning-challenge
Module Twenty One Challenge
Overview
This project aims to help the nonprofit organization Alphabet Soup better predict the success of funding applications submitted by various charitable organizations. Using machine learning techniques — specifically a deep learning neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras — we attempt to classify whether a submitted application will be successful.

Objective
Build and optimize a binary classification model using TensorFlow's Keras API.

Preprocess and encode structured tabular data from a CSV source.

Evaluate model performance using key metrics and iteratively improve it by tuning parameters and network architecture.

Technologies Used
Python 3.9+

Pandas

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Jupyter Notebook

File Structure
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and optimization steps.

resources/charity_data.csv: (Not included in this repo) Raw dataset of charity application records.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Dropped unnecessary or non-informative columns.

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Scaled numerical values using StandardScaler.

2. Model Development
Defined a Sequential model with Keras.

Initial architecture used:

Input layer: Based on number of features.

Hidden layers: 1–2 layers with ReLU activation.

Output layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation (for binary classification).

Compiled with binary crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

Evaluated initial model performance.

3. Optimization and Tuning
Experimented with:

Varying the number of neurons and layers.

Adding dropout layers to reduce overfitting.

Adjusting batch size and number of epochs.

Compared model accuracy across runs to identify improvements.

Results
Final model achieved an accuracy of approximately X% (replace with actual result).

Optimization provided marginal improvement over the base model, though further hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering could lead to better performance.

Conclusion
Through deep learning techniques, we were able to build a predictive model to support Alphabet Soup’s funding decisions. While the model shows reasonable accuracy, additional exploration — including feature selection and model tuning — could enhance its effectiveness.

Future Work
Perform hyperparameter tuning with tools like Keras Tuner.

Engineer additional features or remove redundant ones.

Try alternative classification methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

Deploy model via Flask API for real-time predictions.

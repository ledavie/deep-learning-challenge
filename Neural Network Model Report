Neural Network Model Report: Alphabet Soup Charity
Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis was to build a binary classification model using deep learning to help Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization, determine which charitable funding applications are most likely to be successful. By analyzing historical data on past funding applications, the model aims to improve decision-making by identifying key patterns and factors associated with successful outcomes.

Results
Data Preprocessing
Target Variable:

IS_SUCCESSFUL – This binary variable indicates whether a charity application was successful (1) or not (0).

Feature Variables:

All other variables in the dataset that contain useful information for prediction, including numerical and encoded categorical data (e.g., APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, INCOME_AMT, CLASSIFICATION, etc.).

Removed Variables:

EIN – Employer Identification Number is a unique identifier and not relevant for prediction.

NAME – Organization names do not provide predictive value and could introduce noise.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Initial Model Architecture:

Input Layer: Number of input neurons matched the number of features (after encoding).

Hidden Layers:

Layer 1: 80 neurons, ReLU activation

Layer 2: 30 neurons, ReLU activation

Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

Activation Functions:

ReLU for hidden layers (to avoid vanishing gradients)

Sigmoid for output (to produce probability between 0 and 1)

Model Performance:

Achieved accuracy: ~72% (may vary slightly depending on the final training run).

Target performance: 75% accuracy or higher – The model did not reach this threshold.

Optimization Steps Taken:

Added an additional hidden layer.

Increased and decreased the number of neurons per layer.

Implemented dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Experimented with different batch sizes and epoch counts (e.g., 50, 75, 100).

Attempted feature selection to reduce dimensionality and improve signal-to-noise ratio.

Summary
The deep learning model built for Alphabet Soup was moderately successful, achieving an accuracy of approximately 72%. Despite efforts to optimize the architecture and training process, the model did not reach the target threshold of 75% accuracy.

Recommendation
To improve model performance, we recommend trying ensemble learning methods such as:

Random Forest Classifier or XGBoost:

These models are often more effective with tabular data than deep learning models.

They handle categorical variables and feature importance more intuitively.

They are generally easier to tune and interpret for structured data.

Using these models, combined with rigorous feature engineering and cross-validation, may yield better accuracy and generalization for this binary classification problem.
